# Test Framework for Mercedes Project

This repository contains a Java-based test automation framework developed for testing the hepsiburada website. The framework uses Selenium WebDriver, Cucumber, and Maven to achieve efficient and organized automated testing.

## Features

- Built with Java 11 and Selenium WebDriver 3.141.59.
- Utilizes the POM (Page Object Model) design pattern for maintainable and organized tests.
- In the page classes in the "pages" package, reusable methods(like login()) have been created in the step_definitions classes to avoid hardcoding and long hard-to-read code.
- Dependencies managed with Maven for easy project setup and dependency management.
- Uses bonigarcia webdrivermanager 5.1.0 for WebDriver management.
- Implements BDD (Behavior Driven Development) using Cucumber with cucumber-java and cucumber-junit 7.2.3.
- Generates HTML and Cucumber test reports with reporting-plugin 7.2.0.
- Utilizes the javafaker library for generating fake data in tests.
- Implements WebDriver Singleton Design Pattern for efficient browser management. (Driver class was created with Singleton Design Pattern. Grid was created to use remote browsers. Separate WebDriver was created for each of the frequently used browsers. Since there are only two tests, InheritableThreadLocal was not used. Webdriver InheritableThreadLocal can be used for parallel testing if desired.)
- Supports cross-browser testing with ConfigurationReader and BrowserUtility classes.
- Organizes tests into separate feature files using Gherkin language. (Since the two features are separate from each other, two separate feature files were created and the related user story was written. Login was done with "Backgroud". Since the steps were given in detail, only the given steps were written in a single scenario. Therefore Negative test cases were not created)
- Provides reusable methods in step_definitions to avoid code duplication.
- Handles failed tests with the FailedTestRunner class.
- Uses Hooks class for @Before and @After actions, including screenshot capture for failed tests. (In Hooks Class, only the homepage is navigated with the @Before method. Login could have been done completely here because in both scenarios Login was required. However, this way was preferred to make Features and StepDefs classes more readable.)

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit 11 or higher.
- Maven installed on your machine.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/mehmetakkaya09/Mercedes_Task.git
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Login credentials in `configuration.properties`
4.  Execute tests using Maven or HB_Runner

##  Test Execution 

- Tests are executed using the HB_Runner class located in the `runners` package. 
- Test reports are generated in the `target` directory. 
-  For failed tests, screenshots are captured and saved.

##  Reports

- HTML test report is generated in the `target` directory. 
- Cucumber JSON report is generated by default and can be accessed in the `target` directory.
